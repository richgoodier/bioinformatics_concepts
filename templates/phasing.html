<h2>Phasing in Illumina Sequencing</h2>

<p>
    In Illumina sequencing, phasing errors occur when not all DNA strands in a cluster incorporate a base at the same cycle.
    Over time, this leads to signal degradation, causing growing uncertainty in base calls as the read progresses.
</p>

<p>
    This simulation shows how phasing affects the accuracy of base calling in a single read.
    As the read length increases, phasing errors accumulate, leading to more frequent mismatches.
    Investigate how <strong>error rate</strong> affects the accuracy of the reads.
</p>

        <li>What might cause real sequencing data to show more errors at the end of reads?
