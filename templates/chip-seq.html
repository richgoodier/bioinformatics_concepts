<h2>ChIP-seq and Peak Calling</h2>

<p>
    ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing) is a method for identifying DNA regions bound by specific proteins, such as transcription factors.
    Antibodies are used to isolate protein-bound DNA fragments, which are then sequenced.
    The result is a genome-wide "peak map" that shows where proteins were most likely bound.
</p>

<p>
    In this simulation, we use a synthetic genome of length <strong>500</strong> bases.
    <strong>100</strong> reads are generated based on how closely regions of the genome match a target binding site.
    You can adjust <strong>antibody specificity</strong> to simulate better or worse binding precision.
</p>

    <h4>Questions:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>How did changing the antibody specificity affect the sharpness and height of the peaks?  
            <br><small>(Hint: Consider how affinity is translated into read probability.)</small>
        </li>
        <li>Can you distinguish the good binding sites from the ideal ones just by looking at the peaks?  
            <br><small>(What visual cues or assumptions might help or mislead you?)</small>
        </li>
        <li>In a real ChIP-seq experiment, what kinds of biological or technical noise might obscure true binding sites?  
            <br><small>(Think about sequencing errors, non-specific binding, and read depth.)</small>
